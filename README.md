## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @shermannatrix

So, this isn't my first time on Github FYI. I've been using and supporting GitHub for many years. But in the last few years, out of curiousity, 
I wanted to try out GitLab (https://gitlab.com/shermannatrix). I suppose I'm just curious as to the difference between the two (if any), and also, if the experience in generally the same, then why the heck do we have two options when only one would do. 

I do have an old account on GitHub, but it has since been abandoned and discontinued. So, I think it's important to be aware of that. I was making 
an effort to clear out my old repos, but it got a little tedious, so instead, I've decided to just created a new account. It's probably easier that way.

A clean slate.

## üå± What I'm Currently Learning

### Telerik KendoReact (Kendo UI)

My deep-dive into React 17/18 is on a temporary break. I'm currently in-the-zone when it comes to doing a deep-dive into KendoReact (https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/) by Telerik. The goal is that since I've already acquired the most essential knowledge and skills surrounding React development, I want to convert that into something practical. And nothing is more hands-on than doing a deep-dive into the KendoReact components library. I suspect that there might be some more advanced-level topics that I can do further research into later, so chances are, I might switch between the two topics from time-to-time.

Even though my project showcase idea is not an actual real-world project, it will provide a very close simulation to one. So, my deep-dive into both topics listed here will serve to help me complete the project showcase.

Currently, with regards to KendoReact, I'm working through two of the major product features:
1. Kendo Data Grid (via my weekly live streams - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyhEq7QauJA&list=PLwpxJN0dDkgib8w9vMq_-WZSFf7QB2zNd)
2. Kendo Form (via my own deep-dive and article series - https://www.linkedin.com/in/sherman-chen-weizhi/recent-activity/articles/)

As of this afternoon (23 April 2024), I have already made a decision to move all future articles in the series to my personal website. It isn't the most ideal, but it has certain advantages over using LinkedIn's articles. So I'll figure out a way to make the most of what I have right now.

### React 17/18 Deep-dive

I am currently doing a deep-dive into React 17. I have been learning/using React since 2018. So far, my working experiences range from working 
on a single component to multiple components. I've also worked on a single page (which usually involves multiple components working together). The thing is, 
when I'm working on a project, there isn't a lot of time to do a deep-dive or self-learning. I just go with what I already know, and what already works. 
Most of the time, the work involves a lot of copying and pasting. Followed by customization work. So, there really isn't a lot of learning involved. 
Not really.

Currently, I'm on the topic of consuming Web APIs. Which is nice because it also allows me to start applying it to my own project showcase idea. Which is also currently a work-in-progress.
