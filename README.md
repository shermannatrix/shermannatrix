## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @shermannatrix

So, this isn't my first time on Github FYI. I've been using and supporting GitHub for many years. But in the last few years, out of curiousity, 
I wanted to try out GitLab (https://gitlab.com/shermannatrix). I suppose I'm just curious as to the difference between the two (if any), and also, if the experience in generally the same, then why the heck do we have two options when only one would do. 

I do have an old account on GitHub, but it has since been abandoned and discontinued. So, I think it's important to be aware of that. I was making an effort to clear out my old repos, but it got a little tedious, so instead, I've decided to just created a new account. It's probably easier that way.

A clean slate.

## üéì What I'm Currently Learning (Formal)

(Upcoming) So, thanks to the local government giving up S$4000 in credits for people above 40 to take courses and upskilling, I have decided to use this opportunity to go back to school. It's not full-time learning since I will be working full-time. But it's like once a week. This will be a one-year course on UX Design & Management and it will be a Post-Dip for me. I also will be returning my to former school, Nanyang Polytechnic.

My hope is that this official certification/qualification may help me in the future when it comes to transitioning from my current role in a full-fledge UX design role, or product design/management. This course will begin officially in July 2024.

## üå± What I'm Currently Learning (Informal)

### Android/Kotlin, iOS/Swift

So, it is official that I have recently managed to secure a full-time job as a front-end developer! After nearly two decades of pursuing my passions in UX and front-end development, this is actually the first major breakthrough and success of my professional journey. So yes, this is a huge deal for me. As part of my new role and the first thing that I will be working on is actually the android-version of a product that the company has. So, this company that I will be working for has a software that runs on multiple platforms, which is actually a great opportunity for me. It means I will get to work on the application across all of those platforms eventually. But let's not get too ahead of ourselves. For now, I foresee that at least for the next 12 months or so, I will be spending most of my time on the Android/iOS versions of the app (targeting mobile and tablet devices).

It is why I have been spending some time this month to re-cap and refresh my own Kotlin development skills. And once I have begun working, I hope to use the time that I have to also refresh and update my knowledge and skills in Swift programming. I haven't worked with Swift in a number of years, so I for sure need to relearn some things.

### Material3, react-bootstrap (React, KendoReact by Telerik)

Now, just to be clear, I am not abandoning my current efforts and learning goals. I still want to continue diving into KendoReact by Telerik, and React itself. I am also taking the time to learn more about the various front-end frameworks like react-bootstrap and MUI (especially with Material3).

So my thought-process is to temporarily focus on learning everything there is in Material3 (MUI for react), and react-bootstrap first. And then I will resume my own deep-dive into KendoReact. Let's just say that after everything I have been learning so far, it has given me some ideas of how best to proceed. It might not necessarily be how others might go about it, but we all learn in different ways. And this is just mine.

### SVG & Icons Design

Finally, I am also starting something else. Just something that isn't a top priority in terms of learning. But it is something that I have been avoiding and procrastinating for many many years. When it comes to using icons and adding icons to my projects, I've always been the one to use free icon sets and occasionally, downloading premium ones from sites like Envato Elements. But there will always be that one project that requires a particular type of icon that is unique to the use-case, and then I can't find something that would fit. In that moment, I would feel stuck because I know that I can't design my own icons.

This decision to learn icon design and SVG is so that I can eventually overcome my own fear of learning icon design. I always thought that I might never be good at it. So, I'm going to conquer that fear. I suspect that this is one of those things that will really take a while to learn/master.
